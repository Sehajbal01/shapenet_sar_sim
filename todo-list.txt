- incorporate 2*distance for the signal samples
    - this will have to be in jhihyang's stuff

- SNR stitch experiment

DONE - increased ray density
    DONE - 0, increase to 128x128 images (ez)
    DONE - 1, find the BW/Fs where the curent ray density fails
    DONE - 2, then do a stitch with increasing rays to see where that fixes the failur

- get rid of the ring effect by increasing the signal length in space

- should i adjust the r-points interpolation in the CBP function?
