- manual trajectory input
    - currently accumulate_scatters comes up with all the locations of the synthetic aperture via the "azimuth_spread" parameter
    - we want to calculate the locations OUTSIDE the accumulate scatters function
    - we want straight-line trajectory, curves, etc
    - we want the ability to add noise to the trajectory, like turbulance irl

- add option for LFM pulse in accumulate_scatters
    - this is needed for strip-map mode sar

- use jhihyangs mesh loader instead of the load_mesh function in signal simulation . py
    - extract normals and material_properties from the mesh
        normals = mesh.trimesh.triangles_normal  # (num_triangles, 3)
        material_properties = mesh.trimesh.triangles_rsa  # (num_triangles, 3)

- allow for different material properties in the ground in load_mesh
