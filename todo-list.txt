DONE - incorporate 2*distance for the signal samples
    DONE - this will have to be in jhihyang's stuff

DONE - get rid of the ring effect by increasing the signal length in space
    DONE - in ray_tracer_signal_simulation.py
    DONE - in signal_simulation.py

DONE - adjust ground plane projection such that it falls in line with the projection function along the ground plane, not just projection.
    DONE - make the CBP function exclusively 2D
    DONE - set up projection functions outside CBP
    DONE - get the image rotation correct

DONE - integrate ray tracing module
    DONE - include option for the ray tracing vs rasterization
    DONE - debug ray tracing OOM

DONE - should i adjust the r-points interpolation in the CBP function?
    DONE - yes, because the projection effectively adjusts the spacing between spatial samples

DONE - refine energy equation
    DONE - hardcode rsa
    DONE - incorporate r, s, a components into the mesh
    DONE - load mesh before accumulate scatters

- merge jhihyang's working ray tracer

# after the paper is submitted to radar conf 2026
- manual trajectory input
    - use stop and hop assumption...
- implement strip map mode simulation
