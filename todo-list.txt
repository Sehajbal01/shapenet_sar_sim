DONE - incorporate 2*distance for the signal samples
    DONE - this will have to be in jhihyang's stuff
    DONE - calculate signal with the usual fs/bw
    DONE - place samples in space differently
    DONE - adjust how spatial fs is used in the second orund of interpolation
    DONE - testing needed

DONE - SNR stitch experiment

DONE - increased ray density
    DONE - 0, increase to 128x128 images (ez)
    DONE - 1, find the BW/Fs where the curent ray density fails
    DONE - 2, then do a stitch with increasing rays to see where that fixes the failur

DONE - update snr for complex signal

DONE - implement option for converting to magnitude of the signal for the CBP

DONE - get rid of the ring effect by increasing the signal length in space
    DONE - z_near and z_far are no longer the generaly important
        DONE - specifically decide height/width of ray grid
        DONE - specifically decide height/width of image plane
        DONE - specifically decide the num rows/cols of the image plane
        DONE - specifically decide near/far of the signals
    DONE - increase the size of the ray grid too, because any samples outside the range of scatters will be zero
    DONE - needs testing

NO - should i adjust the r-points interpolation in the CBP function?

DONE - refine energy equation
    DONE - second bounce
    DONE - include scatter/reflection coefficients
    DONE - ground should have higher scatter, car should have higher reflection

- Optionally use Jhih-yangs accumulate scatters function
    DONE - add opption in render_images for rasterization vs ray-tracing
    - include jhihyangs code
