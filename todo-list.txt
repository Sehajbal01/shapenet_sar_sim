- incorporate 2*distance for the signal samples
    - this will have to be in jhihyang's stuff

- get rid of the ring effect by increasing the signal length in space
    DONE - in ray_tracer_signal_simulation.py
    - in signal_simulation.py

- should i adjust the r-points interpolation in the CBP function?

- refine energy equation
    - hardcode rsa

# after the paper is submitted to radar conf 2026
